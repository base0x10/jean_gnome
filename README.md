# JEAN GNOME

A platform for generating and optimizing RedCode assembly programs with genetic algorithms.

I am in the process of rewritting from ocaml to python.  There are missing features.  

## RedCode and CoreWar
CoreWar is a game played by humans who write assembly programs in the RedCode language.  These
programs fight to the death in a single virtual computer core.  It has been compared to the
Olympics of esoteric assembly programming games (Citation Needed). 

If you would like to learn more about CoreWar, I cannot recommend highly enough
[this guide by Ilmari Karonen](http://vyznev.net/corewar/guide.html).  If you would like
to understand the precise rules of of CoreWar, I cannot recommend the official sources. 
However, as there is no better documentation, the ICWS standard can be found
[here](https://corewar.co.uk/standards/icws94.htm) and the defacto standard pMARS extensions can
be found [here](http://www.koth.org/info/pmars-redcode-94.txt).
